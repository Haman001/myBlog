Financial freedom is a term that is still alien to most of the people. We are living from paycheck to paycheck and while 1% of this world is living in unicorn land. 
Are you one of those 1%?
Or 

Do you sale in the same boat as the remaining 99%?

We will let you answer that one yourself. Instead, let’s talk about something that is more recent.  COVID-19. A pandemic that has hit every corner of this world. How would you say it has impacted your financial self-esteem? Has it bought you in a panic situation about your financials. Are you constantly thinking that if it were not for government’s help, your survival would have been in question?

If yes, then trust me, you are not alone. There are many others who are in your shoes. But lets not deny the fact that some are still pretty confident that they have enough savings that could help them last for certain months if not more. There are some people who work the same as you do, but are in a better financial situation than you are. 

What do you think they do different?
Do they skimp or maybe they are just better at understanding/managing money?

There is a famous quote,

>If you can’t manage $1,000 you can’t manage $10,000. You don’t suddenly learn how to handle money by earning more of it. Financial literacy is not a side effect of wealth. Wealth is a side effect of financial literacy.

Many of us don’t understand that understanding money or being financially literate is a thing, but living in an economy that pays you on the basis of hours that you work, and that has a risk of falling down after a sudden shock like COVID-19, financial literacy is must.(You don’t need a financial degree to manage your own money.) No one needs to be a finance expert to manage his own money. It is knowledge of how money works and how a person can make it work for themselves.

Hence, investing your time in learning about ways to plan your spending, financing and investing your money is a skill that will help you on every step of your life.
